    Link Indexer


Fetcher Responsibilities:
    Given a "Fetch" object, check if it has been fetched before (query indexing table)
    if Yes,
        Send Fetch object to Link Indexer
    else
        download all of the html content from the target URL, and send it along to the parser
        if sourceURL is exists (i.e. it wasn't an initial seed url)
            send fetch object to Link Indexer

Link Indexer:
    Given a "Fetch" object, check source URL + targetURL combo already exists in Link db (maybe primary key?)
    if not
        add new entry into LinkDB
        lookup associated targetURL in Indexing Table
            if doesn't exist,
                (spinwait) - case where parser hasn't parsed the new link and/or indexer hasn't indexed link
            //now it exists in indexing table
            increment incoming link count

    Table Schema:
       Source URL (String)  Target URL (String)    anchor Text(String)


Parser:
    Contains Global HashMap mapping Word to Index (in high dimensional word vector)
    Contains Global HashMap mapping Word to NumDocuments it occurs in (for idf)
    Takes incoming HTML Document With Source URL and:
        parses the Title
            adds to Pojo
        parses the Paragraph Text
            lowercase, filter stopwords, apply porter stemmer
            create empty sparse tf vector (doc_hashmap)
            iterate through words
                word = current word
                check if exists in unique word hashmap
                if not, add entry

                lookup the index for word (from global hashmap)
                if exists in (doc_hashmap)
                    increment count
                else
                    increment count for global idf counter hashmap
                    add word + count to doc_hashmap
        parses any <a> tags
            check if tag starts with "/wiki", and if it does, sends to FetcherQueue

        set POJO's numIncomingLinks to 0
        set POJO's list of top tf words and top idf words
        serialize result, send to indexing queue


Indexer:
    takes Indexable Object until accumulates into list of size 100
    bulk insert into index table


Search Engine:
    Convert query into sparse vector
    First Query rows based on if term appears in title or top 100 words
    Then rank rows by title^3, and sparse vector cosine similarity
